            <p>While interested in all of the details of each and every herb, most hygienists really want just a concise account of the most common herbs, their efficacy, precautions, and drug interactions. The National Institute of Health (NIH) is currently conducting extensive research on most herbs, but, in the interim, we need to rely on the research that is currently available. Most of the studies have been conducted in Europe and Asia, since that is where herbs are most widely prescribed by physicians.</p>
            <p>It is imperative that all health care professionals be knowledgeable about precautions and drug interactions relative to herbs. We cannot possibly store all of the information about herbs in our long-term memories any more than we can store all the information about prescription drugs.</p>
            <p><b>Garlic:</b>The active ingredient in garlic is allicin. Most of the allicin is destroyed when cooking, so one would need to consume one to four whole cloves of garlic per day for the therapeutic effects. Because allicin also breaks down with stomach acid, garlic supplements that are entericoated and only released in the small intestine are the most effective. The recommended dosage is 2 to 5 mg of pure allicin daily.<br>

                <mark><b>Precautions</b></mark>: Some people are allergic to garlic, especially atopic individuals. Garlic may cause heartburn, flatulence, and halitosis.</p>
            <p><b>Ginkgo:</b>Studies have shown that ginkgo improves circulation and fosters mild to moderate improvement in memory and cognitive function in Alzheimer`s patients. It is also used to improve sexual dysfunction, especially when the cause is due to adverse effects from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The recommended dosage is 60 mg twice daily.
                <br>
                <mark><b>Precautions</b></mark>: Prolonged use of ginkgo has resulted in a few cases of bilateral subdural hematomas. Adverse effects associated with the use of ginkgo are headaches, dizziness, gastrointestinal disturbance, and vertigo</p>
            <p><b>Ginseng:</b>There is a lack of scientific evidence to support the theories that ginseng builds resistance to stress, boosts energy, acts as an aphrodisiac, or improves circulation in human beings. Most of the valid studies were conducted on animals. The studies conducted on humans have been small and often conflicting.
                <br>
                <mark><b>Precautions</b></mark>: Ginseng acts as a stimulant and, in some individuals, causes nervousness, agitation, headaches, elevated blood pressure, heart palpitations, and insomnia. The estrogenic effects of ginseng may cause breast tenderness and vaginal bleeding. Ginseng may alter bleeding time. It may also alter blood glucose levels, so it should not be used by diabetic patients.</p>
            <p><b>Echinacea:</b>

                An immune system stimulator, echinacea`s mechanism of action is not completely defined. It is believed to occur from stimulation of phagocytes, inhibition of hyaluronidase, and increased production of fibroblasts, properdin, and interferon.<br>
                <mark><b>Precautions</b></mark>: Echinacea is contraindicated in patients with any type of autoimmune disease, AIDS, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, and collagen diseases. It should not be taken continuously by anyone, regardless of the state of health of the individual. Allergies have occurred in very rare incidences.
            </p>
            <p><b>Evening Primrose Oil:</b>

                There is conflicting research on the efficacy of Evening Primrose Oil. Herbalists claim it is effective in the treatment of Ohot flashesO (vasospasms associated with menopause), PMS, weight loss, skin rashes, depression, and other maladies.
                <br>
                <mark><b>Precautions</b></mark>: There is no data to support its absolute effectiveness or safety over the long term.</p>
